    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Like its predecessors for Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Unfinished
    Business for Icewind Dale aims to restore content and quests that were omitted
    from the game as shipped. The additional content in this mod is based on
    what I can piece together from various game resources and from talking with former developer JE Sawyer on the Obsidian forums. </p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Unfinished Business  works with or without the expansions Heart of Winter
    and Trials of the Luremaster. This mod makes interactive changes and therefore
    should be compatible with other mods. The mod was tested with the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/iwd_fixpack/">Icewind Dale
    Fixpack</a> installed (highly recommended), though I do not anticipate
    problems if the Fixpack is not installed. </p>
  <p>A <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=24870">good rundown of install order and incompatibilities</a> for several common Icewind Dale mods is available on the forums. </p>
  <p>Auril's Bane also restores the  Voice of Durdel Anatha quest; if Unfinished
    Business is installed after Auril's Bane then <acronym title="Unfinished Business">UB</acronym>'s
    version of this quest will not be available for installation. In terms of
    install order, <acronym title="Unfinished Business">UB</acronym> should
    follow Auril's Bane. </p>
  <p>Since most of these restorations involve changes to area files (which are
    stored in the save games), they are not available to games in progress if
    you've visited the quest areas already. </p>
  <p>As of version 5, this mod also works on the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=155" title="Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II">Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II</a> mod (currently at beta v7). </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Unfinished Business for <acronym>Icewind Dale</acronym> is packaged and installed
    with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed
    as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive
    and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an ub_iwd folder and setup-ub_iwd.exe
    in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply
    double-click setup-ub_iwd.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-ub_iwd.exe in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em> Unfinished Business for <acronym>Icewind Dale</acronym> is
    packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have an ub_iwd folder, setup-ub_iwd, and
    setup-ub_iwd.command in your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-ub_iwd.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)  		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.  		/usr/bin). </p>
  <p> Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory,  	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries (*). </p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall ub_iwd from your <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> or <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym>-in-<acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory to install or uninstall the mod. </p>
  <p> *:  		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if   you've already ran it  		once in the same directory. To save time, the   archive is already tolowered,  	so there's no need to run the first   option (lowercasing file names) either  		if you've extracted only this   mod since the last time you lower cased file  		name. If you're unsure,   running tolower and choosing both options is the safe  		bet. </p>
</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are nine components, all of which can be installed independently of
    one another. I've tried to be a bit vague with the actual content so as not
    to spoil the restored content; you can always ask for spoilers or additional
    information on the mod's <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=152">discussion
    forum</a>. </p>
  <p><strong>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</strong><br />
    <em>Skipped if Auril's Bane Installed</em> <br />
    This is probably the best known of the missing content, and a slightly
    different version is available as part of the core content of Auril's Bane.
    This component restores the Voice of Durdel Anatha, a cursed paladin of Torm
    forced to wander around Lower Dorn's Deep. The party can free him of his
    curse.</p>
  <p><strong>Malavon's Golems</strong><br />
    There was a book that detailed how Malavon created his twin iron
    golems. The party can possibly deactivate or even turn them against
    Malavon. </p>
  <p><strong>Marketh's Ring</strong><br />
    The trickiest restoration, Marketh originally had a ring that allowed
    him to teleport around Lower Dorn's Deep, making him impossible to catch.
    This idea was eventually abandoned for a different path altogether. I've
    tried to restore this quest while keeping many aspects of the Marketh-Ginafae-Malavon
    relationship as possible, while still restoring the original quest to deal
    with Marketh's ring. </p>
  <p><strong>Expanded Guello/Beorn Quest</strong><br />
    When you speak with the deep gnomes, they actually ask for two things--that
    you kill Shikata and his salamander kin (thus freeing Guello) and also
    to stop the umber hulks that are digging and searching for their hidden
    enclave. Guello will now reward you for both tasks instead of just one
    of them. Note that this also restores a wave of umber hulks in Tarnelm's
    oubliette, making the battle here a bit tougher. </p>
  <p><strong>Presio's Duel</strong><br />
    The third level of Dragon's Eye features Presio and her legions of undead.
    As the party travels the area, she speaks to the party via her undead lieutenants.
    Paladins and mages can call her out to single combat through one of these
    vessels. </p>
  <p><strong>Orrick's Rhino Beetle Shield</strong> <br />
    The duergar Dirty Llew can fashion a shield out of rhino beetle shells for
    the party; Nym can further enchant the shield. As an alternative, the party
    can take Llew's shield to Orrick in Kuldahar instead with a slightly different
    result. </p>
  <p><strong>The High Baptist's Flock</strong> <br />
    Some leftover dialogues and scripting suggested The High Baptist was supposed  to have some followers. When you encounter him on the fifth level of the  Dragon's Eye, he'll now have a small but &quot;loyal&quot; congregation.</p>
  <p><strong>Minor Item Restorations</strong><br />
    A handful of minor items were found in the game files that are not actually available in the game. To minimize influence on game balance these items have primarily been added to stores. New items are the  Belt of Stones, Briath's Journal, Gauntlet of Valor, Great Halberd +4, Holy Chaos! Deck, Inferno Darts +4, Potion of Clear Purpose, Potion of Greater Resistance, Potion of Resistance, Silver Bracers of Kedl, and The Dire Old Lute of Pellon Kay. High quality arrows, bolts, short bows, light crossbows, and heavy crossbows have also been restored as random drops.</p>
  <p><strong>Restored Random Drops</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Heart of Winter</em><br />
    The Heart of Winter expansion alters the random drop table to account for new  items scattered throughout the game. In the process several items were removed  outright, making them no longer available in the game. This component does not  alter items that were simply moved around the table (i.e. Bren Muller's  Crossbow) but it does restore several items to the random drop table:</p>
  <p>Bastard Sword +3: Incinerator, Bhaal's Fire, Demon's Breath, Foe's Fate, Greater Ring of the Warrior, Large Shield of Strength +1, Long Bow +4: Hammer, Long Sword of Action +4, Morning Star +2: Hammer, Morning Star of Action +4, Potion of Arcane Absorption, Potion of Aura Enhancement, Potion of Constitution, Potion of Dissipation, Reinforced Large Shield +2, Ring of Aura Transfusion, Ring of Greater Resistance, Ring of Reckless Action, Ring of the Warrior Thief, Shocking Flail +4, Short Sword +4: Hammer, Sloth, Spiked Long Sword +1, Static Two Handed Sword +4, Studded Leather +2: Shadowed, Studded Leather +4: Shadowed, Studded Leather of Resistance +3, Two Handed Axe of Resistance +3, Two Handed Sword +1: Hammering, Two Handed Sword +3: Bane, Two Handed Sword +4: Backbiter, Two Handed Sword +4: Life Giver, Two Handed Sword of Resistance +1, War Hammer +4: Defender, War Hammer of Phasing +2 (2H), and the War Hammer of Phasing +3.</p>

<h2> Distribution Note </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong formore than a decade and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
    hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work, and players
    get the best, well-supported mods, when we all work together. </p>
  <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
    work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
    from the author(s). </p>
  <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>

<h2>Version History</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Version 7 - November 15, 2012</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added <em>The High Baptist's Flock</em> component and, due to popular demand,  the <em>Restored Random Drops</em> component</li>
    <li>Expanded the <em>Minor Item Restorations</em> component with some unused high quality items, a few more random drops, and the Potion of Clear Purpose</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with <em>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</em> component with the Artisan's District. The umber hulk trap that reveals the Pale Justice sword should wait until the Voice has been laid to rest, but was instead not opening at all if you had previously visited.</li>
    <li>Revisited the treachery detection for<em> Presio's Duel</em> to make it more robust</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with The Glory of Suffering armor, one of the quest rewards for <em>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</em> (thanks to       Minttunator on the forums) </li>
    <li>Added German translation (thanks Mike!)</li>
    <li>Updated the French translation (thanks Anomaly!) and the Russian translation (thanks prowler!)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 6 - September 18, 2012</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added the <em>Minor Item Restorations</em> component</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where <em>Presio's Duel</em> would fail to install on HoW/TotL games if Auril's Bane is installed</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Version 5 - February 14, 2011</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <em>Voice of Durdel Anatha</em> quest was completely recoded, per new information from JE Sawyer</li>
    <li>Fixed bug preventing install if <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> can't find ini files for the<em> Presio's Duel</em> and <em>Expanded Guello/Beorn Quest </em>components</li>
    <li>The option to deactivate or turn Malavon's iron golems is more prominent by way of availability on more branches of dialogue</li>
    <li>The time for Norl to make a copy of Marketh's ring has been substantially reduced</li>
    <li>Closed a bug where you could reset the variable controlling the <em>Marketh's Ring</em> quest midway through, making it impossible to finish, by following a very specific dialogue path with Ginafae if the ring was in progress</li>
    <li>Removed a duplicate line from Ginafae and gave the player better reply options while Norl is making the copy</li>
    <li><em>Presio's Duel</em> could be broken a number of ways due to some loose triggers. These have been tightened up and better detection for treachery (i.e. agreeing to single combat and then sending multiple characters) to make this work as expected</li>
    <li>Now works with the <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showforum=155" title="Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II">Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II</a> mod</li>
